>Geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, solids, and higher dimensional analogs. For more information follow:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry>

>Elementary operations can refer to operations in elementary arithmetic as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Elementary row operations or elementary column operations especially in Matrix. For more information follow:

>In geometry, a polygon is a plane figure that is described by a finite number of straight line segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain. The bounded plane region, the bounding circuit, or the two together, may be called a polygon. For more information follow:
