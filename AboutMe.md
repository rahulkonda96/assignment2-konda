# RAHUL KONDA

Hi, This is Rahul Konda. I'm from India. A reserved person,  music lover and intrested in photography. Always want to travel in search of food. Especially spicy food and sweets. Worked in IT industry and flew to Missouri to do my Masters. Hangover with friends on weekends, capturing them and cherishing is a beautiful part of my life.
